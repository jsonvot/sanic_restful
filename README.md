# Sanic RESTful API
## Simple and easy-to-use sanic restful API, can generate normal OpenAPI documentation.

> I previously searched online for similar incomplete solutions and found that the generated OpenAPI specifications often had issues and lacked flexibility. Therefore, I referred to some other frameworks and combined them with my own ideas to write a demo. This demo might have some issues and is just for reference.

## Guide
1.  Install required libraries
   ```pip install sanic[ext]==23.12.1```
3.  Run
   ```sanic main:app -H localhost -p 9001 --auto-reload```
